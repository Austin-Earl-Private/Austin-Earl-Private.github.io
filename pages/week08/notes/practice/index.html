      <h2>Canvas rendered line chart </h2>
      <p>This is a pure canvas rendered line chart. Its still a work in progress, though I'm starting to get a hang of it's quarks.</p>
      <p>A few things to add to it...<br>
         Mouse hover over dots to see values<br>
         Lines and numbers rendered on the sides
      </p>
      <p>Have fun and play arround with it. Its not hardened so it might error out till I fix the bugs. -_-</p>
      <div class="graph">
        <canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas"  >
          Sorry! Your browser doesnâ€™t support Canvas.
      </canvas>
      </div>
      <button id="recalulate">recalulate</button>
      <input type="number" name="size" id="size" placeholder="Height of the graph">
      <input type="text" name="numbers" id="numbers" placeholder="-10,50,30,20,-9">
      <p>Type in the hight to set the height in px of the graph it defaults to 200</p>
      <p>Note there is buffer space of 20 px on each side... so anything less than 40 will be fliped and squished.</p>
      <p>Type in numbers separated by commas to change the points on the graph it defaults to -10,50,30,20,-9</p>
